Thaumaturge is a comprehensive Minecraft magic mod that introduces a sophisticated magic system inspired by Thaumcraft, with unique mechanics centered around magical aspects, resonance gauntlets, and intricate spellcrafting.

## Features

### Core Magic System
- **Aspect-Based Magic**: 37 magical aspects organized in a hierarchical structure (Primal → Secondary → Tertiary → Quaternary)
- **Resonance Mechanics**: Aspects interact through amplification, opposition, and neutralization
- **Foci & Gauntlets**:
    - Three tiers of foci (Lesser, Advanced, Greater) for different targeting types
    - Gauntlets with increasing capacity (1-3 foci slots)
- **Spellcrafting**: Combine foci in gauntlets to create complex spells based on:
    - Aspect combinations
    - Resonance modifiers
    - Foci tiers

### Unique Mechanics
- **Quintessence & Aether**: Fundamental magical energy and its physical manifestation
- **Consequences System**: Magic use has physiological effects and can create "Dead Zones"
- **Material System**:
    - Aspect Cluster Shards (found in specific biomes)
    - Quicksilver (for lenses)
    - Runic Ingots (for magical equipment)
- **Multiple Practitioner Types**:
   - Thaumaturges
   - Archmages
   - Wizards
   - Witches
   - Mages
   - Sorcerers

### Visual & Auditory
- **Aetheric Goggles**: See aspects in the world
- **Aspect Lenses**: Examine items for their aspects
- **Custom Particles & Sounds**: Unique effects for different aspects
